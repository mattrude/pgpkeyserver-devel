That key will then be stored on each of those servers in addition to this server.  Due to the transferring of keys between servers not managed by a central hosts, deleting a key is not possible at this time.  If a key were deleted from this server, other servers in the pool will restore the key in order to maintain a complete collection.  This is the servers intended behavior.</i></p>
