Today I upgraded SKS to version 1.1.5+ by applying the patch from pull requests [#33](https://bitbucket.org/skskeyserver/sks-keyserver/pull-request/33/add-support-for-eddsa-key-using-ed25519/diff). This [patch](https://bitbucket.org/kristianf/sks-keyserver/commits/40280f59d0f503da1326972757168aa42335573f/raw/) will add support for EdDSA key using the Ed25519 signature scheme, more infromation may be found on the [issues page](https://bitbucket.org/skskeyserver/sks-keyserver/issue/31/support-for-eddsa).
