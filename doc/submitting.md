## How-to submit a key

1. Cut-and-paste an ASCII-armored version of your public key into the text box.
1. Press **Submit key to pool**.

That is it! The keyserver will process your request immediately. If you like, you can check that your key exists using the [extract]({{ site.url }}/doc/extracting/) procedure.
